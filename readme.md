# dScripts

## Hello

This is a public repository where I have placed my "myscripts folder" from my machine

I did this mostly so that I can just clone it on my other machine to keep the directory the same between them as I add to the folder.

It is literally just scripts that I wrote because I thought they might be handy

Do literally whatever you want with it.

If you clone/download it keep in mind that the scripts assume they are being stored in a folder called "myscripts" in the home directory.  So if you put it somewhere else or name it something else then you will have to fix them.  Not that they are very long or anything, just saying

Also, if you wish to be able to run these scripts from anywhere like a program from /bin, then you must add the folder's path to the $PATH system variable

I accomplished this by placing "PATH="$PATH:~/myscripts" " in my .profile file.  Depending on your system, you may want to place this in your .bashrc file.  Don't forget to source the file afterwards, or restart.

There's not much else to say, what you see is what you get
